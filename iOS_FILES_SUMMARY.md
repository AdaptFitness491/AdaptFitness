---

## KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS:

### Simulator Limitations:
1. **Camera:** Barcode scanner won't work (needs physical device)
2. **Keychain:** Works in simulator, but data persists between builds

### Production Considerations:
1. **Token Refresh:** Not yet implemented (access tokens expire in 15min)
2. **Offline Mode:** No offline data caching
3. **Image Upload:** Not yet implemented for CameraPicker
4. **Meal Logging:** Not yet connected to backend

---

## DEPENDENCIES USED:

All are built-in iOS frameworks:
- **Foundation** - Core Swift functionality
- **SwiftUI** - UI framework
- **Combine** - Reactive programming (@Published properties)
- **Security** - Keychain access
- **AVFoundation** - Camera and barcode scanning

**No third-party dependencies required!**

---

## SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Secure Token Storage:**
   - JWT tokens stored in iOS Keychain
   - Never stored in UserDefaults
   - Encrypted by iOS automatically

2. **HTTPS Only:**
   - Production URL uses HTTPS
   - All network requests encrypted

3. **Password Validation:**
   - Client-side validation before sending to server
   - Server-side validation for additional security

4. **Session Management:**
   - Tokens automatically added to all authenticated requests
   - Automatic logout on token expiration
   - Session persistence across app launches

---

## NEXT STEPS:

1. **Add files to Xcode project** (follow instructions above)
2. **Build and fix any compilation errors**
3. **Run in simulator and test authentication**
4. **Test on physical device for barcode scanning**
5. **Implement token refresh mechanism** (future enhancement)
6. **Add offline data caching** (future enhancement)
7. **Connect meal logging to backend** (future feature)
