   - Add Files to AdaptFitness
   - Add: Core/ folder (with Network and Auth subfolders)
   - Add: Views/Auth/ folder
   - Build (Cmd+B) and fix any errors

**2. Test Login/Register:**
   - Run on simulator (Cmd+R)
   - Try registering a new user
   - Try logging in
   - Should connect to production backend!

**3. Once Login Works:**
   - Build WorkoutViewModel
   - Build WorkoutListView
   - Complete MVP!
