# Conflicts Resolved - AdaptFitness Frontend Integration

## ðŸ”§ Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Port Conflicts (EADDRINUSE)**
**Problem**: Multiple Node.js processes were running on port 3000, causing server startup failures.

**Solution**: 
- Killed all existing Node.js processes: `pkill -f "nodemon\|ts-node.*main.ts"`
- Cleared port 3000: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
- Started fresh backend server instance

**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED**

### 2. **Meal Module Export Conflicts**
**Problem**: `MealModule` was missing the `exports: [MealService]` configuration, preventing the goal calendar from accessing meal data.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Added to meal.module.ts
exports: [MealService],
```

**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED**

### 3. **Meal Entity Field Naming Conflicts**
**Problem**: Mismatch between backend entity field names and iOS Swift model field names:
- Backend: `totalCalories`, `totalProtein`, `totalCarbs`, etc.
- iOS: `calories`, `protein`, `carbs`, etc.

**Solution**: Updated all iOS Swift models and views to match backend field names:
- Updated `Meal.swift` model
- Updated `CreateMealRequest.swift` 
- Updated `MealListView.swift`
- Updated `AddMealView.swift`
- Updated `MealViewModel.swift`

**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED**

### 4. **Missing Meal Entity Fields**
**Problem**: iOS models were missing fields that exist in the backend entity.

**Solution**: Added missing fields to iOS models:
- `servingSize: Double?`
- `servingUnit: String?`

**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED**

## ðŸ§ª Integration Test Results
