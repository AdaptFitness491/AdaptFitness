## 🔍 Frontend-Backend Integration Gaps

### Currently Using Hardcoded Data
The iOS app is currently **NOT** connected to the backend. All data is hardcoded:

```swift
// HomeView.swift - Line 19-24
let user: User
@State private var goals: [Goal] = Goal.exampleGoals
@State private var fitnessRecords: [FitnessRecord] = FitnessRecord.exampleRecords
@State private var foods: [FoodEntry] = FoodEntry.exampleFoodEntries
```

### Services Need Implementation
All service files are either empty or commented out:

1. **UserService.swift** - Authentication methods commented out
2. **FitnessService.swift** - Only has local calorie calculation
3. **NutrtionService.swift** - Completely empty
4. **GoalService.swift** - Empty

## 🚀 What the Backend Already Supports

### ✅ Currently Available Backend Endpoints

### ❌ What Backend Does NOT Yet Support

#### Goals System (Frontend needs this!)
- ❌ No Goal entity/endpoints yet
- Frontend has Goal model ready but no backend support
- Need to create:
  - `POST /goals` - Create goal
  - `GET /goals` - Get user goals
  - `PATCH /goals/:id` - Update goal progress
  - `DELETE /goals/:id` - Delete goal

#### Barcode/Food Database
- ❌ No barcode lookup API
- ❌ No nutrition database integration
- Frontend has barcode scanner UI but no backend to support it
- Need external API integration (e.g., OpenFoodFacts, Nutritionix)

#### Favorite Workouts
- ❌ No favorites/saved workouts system
- Frontend has FavoriteWorkout model but no backend

## 📋 Integration To-Do List

### Priority 1: Connect Existing Features (High Priority)
1. **Implement iOS APIService layer** (networking foundation)
   - Create `APIService.swift` with request/response handling
   - Add JWT token management
   - Implement refresh token logic
   
2. **Connect UserService to Backend**
   - Implement authentication (login/register)
   - Token storage in Keychain
   - User profile fetching

3. **Connect Workouts**
   - Fetch user workouts from backend
   - Create new workouts via API
   - Fetch workout streak (backend already supports this!)

4. **Connect Meals**
   - Fetch user meals from backend
   - Create new meals via API
   - Fetch meal streak

### Priority 2: Add Missing Backend Features (Medium Priority)
1. **Goals System Backend**
   - Create Goal entity
   - Create GoalModule with CRUD endpoints
   - Add goal progress calculation logic

2. **Barcode/Nutrition Integration**
   - Research and integrate external nutrition API
   - Create nutrition lookup endpoint
   - Cache nutrition data in database

### Priority 3: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
1. **Favorite Workouts**
   - Add favorites table/entity
   - Create favorite workout endpoints
   
2. **Settings/Preferences**
   - User settings entity
   - Settings CRUD endpoints

## 🔄 Model Alignment Check

### ✅ Models That Match
- **User** - iOS model simplified but compatible
- **Workout** - iOS model needs to align with backend (iOS uses String types, backend uses enums)
- **Meal** - Generally compatible, iOS expects foods array

### ⚠️ Models That Need Alignment
- **Workout** - iOS uses `String` for calories, backend uses `Double` (totalCaloriesBurned)
- **Workout** - iOS has `intensity` field, backend doesn't
- **FoodEntry** - Backend uses Meal model differently, needs review
- **Goal** - iOS model exists, backend model doesn't exist yet

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### For Backend Team (You):
1. ✅ **Done** - All core CRUD endpoints working
2. ⏳ **Next** - Add Goals system to match frontend expectations
3. ⏳ **Next** - Research and add nutrition/barcode API integration

### For Frontend Team:
1. ⏳ Implement `APIService.swift` networking layer
2. ⏳ Connect `UserService` to backend auth endpoints
3. ⏳ Replace hardcoded data with real API calls
4. ⏳ Test camera/barcode on real device

### For Both Teams:
1. ⏳ Align Workout model fields (intensity, calorie types)
2. ⏳ Define Meal/FoodEntry relationship clearly
3. ⏳ Test full authentication flow iOS → Backend
4. ⏳ Test streak calculation display on frontend

## 📊 Current Status

| Feature | Backend Ready | Frontend UI | Integration Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Authentication | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% (not connected) |
| User Profile | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% (hardcoded) |
| Workouts | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% (hardcoded) |
| Workout Streak | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% (not connected) |
| Meals | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% (hardcoded) |
| Health Metrics | ✅ 100% | ⏳ 50% | ❌ 0% (no UI yet) |
| Goals | ❌ 0% | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% (backend missing) |
| Barcode Scanner | ❌ 0% | ⏳ 80% | ❌ 0% (backend missing) |
| Favorites | ❌ 0% | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% (backend missing) |

## 🚨 Critical Blockers

1. **No iOS-Backend communication** - APIService not implemented
2. **Goals backend missing** - Frontend ready but backend doesn't exist
3. **Barcode API missing** - Frontend has UI but no backend support
4. **Model misalignment** - Workout fields don't match exactly

## ✅ What's Going Well

1. **Backend is solid** - All core endpoints tested and working
2. **Frontend UI is beautiful** - Great UX with calendar, goals, streaks
3. **Both teams moving fast** - Good progress on both sides
4. **Security is solid** - Backend has auth, rate limiting, password validation
