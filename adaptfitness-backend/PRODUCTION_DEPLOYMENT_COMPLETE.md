## 📱 iOS Integration Ready

### **For iOS App:**

Update your `APIService.swift` base URL:

```swift
class APIService {
    // Production URL
    private let baseURL = "https://adaptfitness-production.up.railway.app"
    
    // Or use environment-based switching:
    private let baseURL: String = {
        #if DEBUG
        return "http://localhost:3000"
        #else
        return "https://adaptfitness-production.up.railway.app"
        #endif
    }()
}
```

### **Test from iOS:**
1. Update base URL in APIService
2. Build and run iOS app
3. Register a new user
4. Login
5. Create workouts
6. View workout streak
